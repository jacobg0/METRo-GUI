# METRo-GUI
This GUI is an add-on to METRo in order to facilitate the use to those unfamiliar with Linux commands. Through this GUI the user will be able to quickly select their forecast data, observation data, station data and roadcast file and then run it in METRo.

Additionally added are two python scripts, one for the forecast data and one for the observation data. These scripts will convert .csv files to the specific .xml input data format that METRo needs to run.
